THE SALESMAN

Hi! Hi! Who will buy
A wee little cloud for the pretty blue sky?
Some are purple, some are red,
And all are soft as a feather bed.
Hi! Little children, won't any one buy
One little cloud for the pretty blue sky?

Excerpt from "The Peter Patter Book of Nursery Rhymes" by Leroy F. Jackson, Rand McNally & Company, 1918.
