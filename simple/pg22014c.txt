PETER, POPPER

Peter, popper, dopper, Dan,
Catch a moonbeam if you can;
Climb a cedar ten feet high
And pick the planets from the sky.
You're a wonder, little man--
Peter, popper, dopper, Dan.

Excerpt from "The Peter Patter Book of Nursery Rhymes" by Leroy F. Jackson, Rand McNally & Company, 1918.
